# 🧠 HNX Kernel

## 🤖 The First AI-Only Operating System Experiment

> **A groundbreaking experiment: Can AI independently design and implement a complete modern operating system, with humans providing only guidance and review?**

## 🎯 Mission

Build **HNX** (Hybrid N Unix) - a modern hybrid kernel OS with zero human-written code. Every line is generated by AI based on requirements and architecture discussions.

### Core Principles
- **100% AI-generated code**: Humans define what to build, AI determines how to build it
- **Hybrid microkernel architecture**: Security of microkernels with performance of monolithic kernels  
- **ohlink binary format**: Novel executable format with built-in capability security
- **Full POSIX compatibility**: Support existing Unix/Linux ecosystem
- **Pure Rust implementation**: Leverage modern memory safety guarantees
- **aarch64 native**: Designed for future processor architectures

## 🛠️ AI Development Stack

### Primary Development Environment
- **🧠 TRAE AI IDE**: Primary code generation and architecture design
- **🤖 GitHub Copilot**: Real-time code completion and suggestions
- **💬 Claude 3.5 Sonnet**: Strategic planning and complex problem solving
- **🔧 Local RAG System**: Project context and knowledge management

### TRAE's Role in This Project
TRAE AI IDE serves as the **central nervous system** of this experiment:
- Understands natural language requirements for OS features
- Generates architecturally sound Rust code for kernel components  
- Maintains consistency across thousands of lines of system code
- Debugs complex hardware interaction issues through QEMU logs
- Iterates based on compilation errors and runtime failures

## 📊 Current Status

### 🟢 Implemented
- Boot process from reset vector to kernel entry
- Physical/virtual memory management (4-level page tables)
- Basic process management with EL0/EL1 privilege switching
- VFS layer with RamFS and DevFS
- Serial console and logging system

### 🟡 In Progress
- Interrupt system (GIC, timer, exception vectors)
- System call interface and IPC mechanisms
- Scheduler with basic Round-Robin algorithm
- Userland C runtime and simple shell

### 🔴 Planned
- ohlink binary format and loader
- Migration to hybrid architecture (userspace services)
- Capability-based security model
- TCP/IP network stack from scratch

## ⚠️ Important Notice

This is an **experimental research project**:
1. All code is AI-generated and may contain vulnerabilities
2. Not recommended for production use
3. Project direction may change based on AI capabilities
4. Human review required for all generated code
